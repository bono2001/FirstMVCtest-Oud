CollectionBox - Your Ultimate Collection Tracker
Welcome to CollectionBox! 🎉 This is my first project using the MVC framework, developed as part of a school project. CollectionBox is designed to help you easily track, organize, and manage all the items in your various collections. Whether you collect action figures, posters, or rare antiques, CollectionBox has got you covered!

What does CollectionBox do?
CollectionBox is your personal, customizable collection manager. It allows you to:

📝 Add and track items across multiple collections.
🔍 Organize items by categories, conditions, and other attributes.
💰 Keep an eye on the value and purchase details of your prized possessions.
📦 Manage items that are for sale or for trade with just a few clicks.
This app is built using the MVC pattern and leverages SQL Server Management Studio 19 to handle the database side, ensuring robust data management for your collections. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with databases, learning how to structure and query data efficiently while bringing this idea to life.
